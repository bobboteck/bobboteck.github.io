The plaYbox is a recycled wooden box, with five **Buttons** equipped with **Leds**, used as a game for children.
I had this idea, when casually surfing the internet I came across these big buttons, and having already seen my daughter's (less than 2 years old) interest in playing with the bright (but dangerous) switches present in the house, I thought to use them to build a game.

The project was based on **Arduino Uno**, I use a prototipe shield to connect all buttons and leds. The complete code is available on [GitHib repositry](https://github.com/bobboteck/plaYbox), if you like it remember to put a **Star**.

## The wooden box

I find in the home an old wooden box, it was a gift I had received, originally it contained two bottles of beer and a glass, the dimensions were perfect and even the internal tablets immediately seemed to help me to support the necessary electronics. The dimension are 25x25x12 cm.

First I drew the diagonals by joining the vertices of the square on the smooth surface, in this way I found the center of the box to be able to make the first hole.
The other four holes I made about 12 cm from the center, all the holes are 25mm.
Then I drilled an extra hole for a push switch to use to turn the game on and off.
