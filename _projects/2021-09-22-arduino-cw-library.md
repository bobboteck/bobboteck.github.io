This Arduino CW Library is not limited to turning on a LED, or to controlling a single I/O pin. CWLibrary uses two callbacks to user-defined functions, the two functions represent the state in which a signal is transmitted and the state in which it is not transmitted. In this way, the user can indicate anything in the functions, from simple commands for switching on or off a LED to even more complex commands or for objects other than common Arduino peripherals.
