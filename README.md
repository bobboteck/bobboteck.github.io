This is the repository of my site, that you can see at [https://bobboteck.github.io](https://bobboteck.github.io), here you can find a diary of my works on:

- Robotics
- Electronic
- Software
- Amateur radio

## Applications

I have also created some web applications, which you can use directly from your computer's browser, such as:

- **[Serial Monitor](https://bobboteck.github.io/app/serial-monitor/index.html)**, just connect a serial device to the PC and open the page with a Browser that supports the Serial API, to be able to monitor data traffic and send messages
- **QSO Map generator**, actually work in progress, is an application to generate data file to include a Map of QSO in an HTML page. You ca see an example in this [page of my web site](https://bobboteck.github.io/sota/sota-monte-elefante/)

## Site theme

The site was builded with [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
